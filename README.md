# Task-2-GRIP-Prediction-using-Unsupervised-Machine-Learning.
This is my second task during my internship in Data Science &amp; Business Analytics at The Sparks Foundation.The task is to train the Iris dataset to predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually. I have trained the model using Kmeans and used the elbow method to find the optimum number of clusters.
